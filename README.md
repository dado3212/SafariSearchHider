SafariSearchHider is a Cydia tweak that adds the options to create regex or wildcard strings that will 
not be saved in Safari search history.

### Installation

To install it, either install from the .deb, or add the repository http://cydia.alexbeals.com to Cydia and download SafariSearchHider.

### Modification

To start modifying it, simply copy the full folder in, and then symlink folders called 'theos' to $(THEOS) in both the preferences folder and the main folder.  You can create and install the tweak using 'make package install'.

You'll also need a custom set of `include` files in the $(THEOS) directory, which I will update this with at a later date.  I used the iOS8.1 SDK to maintain backwards compatability.
